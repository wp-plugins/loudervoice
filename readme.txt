Accept and Display LouderVoice Reviews on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin enables LouderVoice clients to quickly and easily display customer reviews on their WordPress site.

== Installation ==

Upload the LouderVoice plugin to your site and activate it. 

Go to Settings -> LouderVoice Settings and add your LouderVoice API key, Facebook App ID, and LouderVoice CSS URL. 
LouderVoice will give you these it you don't already have them. 

Then create a new page on your site where you wish to display reviews and tick the "Enable Reviews" box. Decide on the basic options presented and finally decide if you want open-reviewing on that page or you want a separate private review-writing page which you invite people to.
